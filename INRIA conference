ILAB: an End-to-End Active Learning System
In-situ annotations + provide a family ex: mails,spam,phising,malware (and binary label for detection targets)

how to build a detection model :
you need data, annotated (malicious or benign) for training
this step depends on what you consider malicious (what u want ur model to find)

raw data -> feature extraction & annotation-> training dataset
find feature that have discriminative power (=expert knowledge & knowledge about target)

find a good model class for the training

final evaluation provides feedback on the changes to bring to the model

malicious families > alert taxonomy

-- iterative process : unlabeled data -> annotation queries -> expert -> new annotated instances -> annotated -> training -> unlabeled data

uncertainty sampling : doesnt work well with false positives/negatives

ILAB : active learning strategy
binary logistic regression, uncertainty sampling, rare category detection
rcd -> annotate close to the center of the cluster and close to the edge
parallelised : computation (malicious/benign)+annotation on ?data
github/ANSSI-FR/SecuML

expressiveness of the features :

make features evolve manually or automatically (Khiops)

avoid sampling biases
maintain low waiting periods
generic annotation interface
family editor
user experiments !

SecuML :
annotate data with ILAB
DIADEM : DIAgnosis of DEtection Models
CLustering : K-means, Gaussian Mixtures, etc...
